# Django Authentication

This repository contains a Django project with a basic setup for routing. It demonstrates how to define routes and corresponding views in Django.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/django-routing.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd django-routing
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies:

   ```
   python -m venv env
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

   - On Windows:
     ```
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```

5. Install the project dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Run the Django development server:

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8000` to access the application.

## Usage

This Django project demonstrates how to define routes using the `urls.py` file. Here is an example of the defined routes:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
    path('about/', views.about, name='about'),
    path('/signin', views.signin, name='signin'),
    path('/signun', views.signup, name='signup')
]
```

- The root URL (`''`) maps to the `home` view function.
- The `/about/` URL maps to the `about` view function.
- The `/contact/` URL maps to the `contact` view function.

Each view function simply renders a corresponding HTML template.
